I am an assistant professor in the Mechanical Engineering Department at the University of California at Berkeley. I run the <a href="https://iconresearchlab.web.illinois.edu/">ICON</a> Lab. The focus of my research is to develop control algorithms that allow autonomous systems to safely and intelligently interact with each other and with humans. To this end, I draw from the fields of <span class="keyword">control theory</span>, <span class="keyword">robotics</span>, <span class="keyword">game theory</span>, and <span class="keyword">machine learning</span>. I was a Postdoctoral Scholar in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at Stanford from 2019 to 2020. I received my PhD in Mechanical engineering at UC Berkeley in 2019 and received my bachelorâ€™s degree in Mechanical Engineering at Sharif University of Technology in 2013.
